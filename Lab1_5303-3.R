# Q1: use sample function to generate a random 20x20 matrix A with integers in [-10, 10]. 
# note that A corresponds to a system of linear equations



# Q2: generate a solution vector b with real numbers in [-10, 10]
# print A and b



# Q3: print the 2nd row of A



# Q4: print the 3rd column of A



# Q5: print the element of A in the 6th row and the 15th column 



# Q6: combine A and b to one augmented matrix M = [A|b]



# Q7: Think of a way to double check M is correct. Remember M, A are large size.
# hint: One possible way: check M by printing out summation of the 1st row of M,A and 1st element of b
